## Helping
Want to help us decompile these games? Well, the decomps are free and open source over here on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/WiiDecomp), and you can contribute by just editing a file and submitting a pull request.

## Want a game decompiled?
If you want a game to be decompiled, go over [here](https://www.github.com/WiiDecomp/WiiDecomp.github.io/discussions) and request it. We'll (try to) get our hands on the particular game, and we will attempt at decompiling it.
